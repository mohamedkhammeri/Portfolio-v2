# 🌐 Personal Website to Introduce Yourself

Welcome to my personal website project! This is a simple and elegant theme to help you introduce yourself online.

## 🚀 Getting Started

I developed this project as a personal venture, inspired by the amazing work of [Brittany Chiang](https://github.com/bchiang7). You can check out her repo [here](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4).

Since I'm not an expert in ReactJS (which Brittany's project uses), but I loved her design, I decided to recreate it using Angular's architecture.
Feel free to contribute, suggest ideas, or improve the architecture! I'd love to hear your thoughts or suggestions. 😊

## 📋 Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need to have:

1. **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) installed. You can download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Angular CLI** installed globally on your machine.

### To install Angular CLI, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## 🛠 Installing

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 💻 Running the Project

Once everything is set up, start the project by running:

```bash
npm start
```

Wait for the project to compile, and then open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser.

## 🚨 Important!

I want to quote what Brittany mentioned in her project regarding forking and attribution:

### Forking this repo (please read!)
> Many people have contacted me asking if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer is usually yes, with attribution. I value keeping my site open source, but plagiarism is bad. It’s always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask is for you to not claim this effort as your own.

Since I have attributed Brittany's work, I kindly ask that you do the same for both of us if you use this project. Thank you! 🙌

### 📣 Contributing

If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to contribute by submitting a pull request or opening an issue. I appreciate any contributions that help improve the code, structure, or design.

## ✨ Thanks for Visiting!

Enjoy building your own personal website with this theme! 😄
